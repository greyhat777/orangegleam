<h3 class="faq">How To Compare Web Development Companies?</h3>	
<p class="format">Without a doubt, there are a lot of web development, web-design, and marketing companies that all seem to be offering their clients the same services, itâ€™s just that each company presents this information a bit differently. </p><br/>
<p class="format">With so many web development companies out there, how is a potential client supposed to choose the best company to work with? Some might say, well, just look at their portfolio section; however, these are only designs, that are subjective to each individuals interpretation of what they believe looks good. </p><br/>
<p class="format">There are free resources on the internet such as <a href="https://validator.w3.org">https://validator.w3.org/</a> and <a href="http://www.gtmetrix.com">www.gtmetrix.com</a> that give you a strong indication of how well any website is put together. Having an error free website that loads quickly is essential to a website that wants to be ranked high in search engines such as Google. There are other strategies as well, but this is a must if you want the best rankings possible. </p><br/>

<p class="format">It would be fair to assume that website addresses that are error free, and get a good percentage on gtmetrix are websites of high quality that well rank well over time, because the structure code was written so perfectly.</p><br/>
<p class="format"><a href="http://www.orangegleam.com">www.Orangeleam.com</a> would like to invite you to compare our work, with that of any competitor using the tools mentioned above. Would you rather pay to have an error free website that loads quickly? Or the opposite? www.Orangegleam.com can help you with an error free website, with high scores on www.gtmetrix.com if you choose to work with us. </p><br/>
