			<h3><img src="images/arrw1.png" alt="about us at orangegleam"/>about us</h3>
			<p>OrangeGleam.com is a Fresno website design company that Jesus Tellez decided to start in order to solve a problem that he kept noticing throughout his experience as a web developer; he found that many websites currently are only written in one language. This is a problem to organizations and businesses that are seeking to reach as many people as possible, because they are limiting their marketing exposure. </p>
			<p>Just imagine what a bilingual or a multilingual website can do for your business or organization? Even if you don’t wish to conduct business in another language, you at least bring more exposure to your marketing brand and as a result more credibility to your website. If the fear of not speaking another language is holding you back from setting up a multilingual website, don’t worry about it. We can easily take care of this for you. Perhaps you think it might be expensive to setup a website in more than one language, well, think again, our process very affordable.</p>

			<p>We decided to hire Jesus from orangegleam.com to build our soccer league website, and we are happy we did. He delivered a great looking website that we are able to update ourselves very easily. He was very professional, communicated with us very well, and was really easy to work with. We will definitely use Jesus and orangegleam.com again for future projects. </p>
